Water quality geospatial data can be queried from the [EPA](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#countrycode=US&mimeType=csv&providers=NWIS&providers=STEWARDS&providers=STORET)

- Water quality metrics need to be investigated, it is not clear what they mean on a first glance
- Air Quality Data are at the county level so not granular enough.
