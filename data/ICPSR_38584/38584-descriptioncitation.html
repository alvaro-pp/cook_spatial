		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This dataset contains measures of traffic volume per census tract and ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) in the United States from 1963 to 2019 (primarily 1997 to 2019). High traffic volume may be used as a proxy for heavy traffic, high traffic speeds, and impediments to walking or biking. The dataset contains measures of the average, maximum, and minimum traffic volume per year or per ZCTA per year. These figures are available for all streets, highways, and non-highways. In the ZCTA dataset, data is collected intermittently across locations over time, therefore traffic volume has been interpolated for years in which no measures are available. Data Source: Traffic volume measurements are derived from Kalibrate's TrafficMetrix database accessed via Esri Demographics. Census tract boundaries come from the 2010 TIGER/Line shapefiles. ZCTA boundaries come from the 2019 TIGER/Line shapefiles.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this study is to characterize the average volume of traffic passing through a census tract and a ZIP code tabulation area in a given year.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>The research team used three different types of traffic counts within TrafficMetrix: average annual daily traffic, average annual weekday traffic, and average daily traffic. For each corresponding location, the team obtained its latitude and longitude and whether the location is on a highway, then assigned latitudes and longitudes to census tracts and zip code tabulation areas (ZCTA). The team then determined the average, maximum, minimum, and number of traffic volume measurements across all locations in a tract and ZCTA in a given year. Separate measurements were created for highway traffic vs. non-highway traffic.</p>
<p>Traffic measurements are not available in every year. For the ZCTA data, the team interpolated values for certain years between observations due to the lack of measurements taken during that year. Missing values were created using a linear interpolation of the two nearest non-missing years. In the census tract data, measures were not interpolated for missing years.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Cross-sectional</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Census tracts or ZIP code tabulation areas in the United States, excluding U.S. island territories.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> ZIP code tabulation area, census tract</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Source:</strong> Data and documentation for the ZCTA-level data were originally deposited in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E160261">openICPSR project 160261</a>., Data and documentation for the census tract-level data were originally deposited in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E160262">openICPSR project 160262</a>., ZIP code tabulation area boundaries come from the 2019 TIGER/Line shapefiles (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019)., Kalibrate.
