------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To do**

-   Assemble a geolocated spatial dataset containing relevant covariates related to the built environment in Cook County, Chicago

-   Try to find environmental/natural environment exposure data (e.g, exposure to noise, toxic waste)

-   Note: For analysis, ensure reweighting by time at home and out of home

-   Create standardized naming conventions for variables.

**General Questions of Interest**

-   What explanatory power does information about amenities and neighborhood features have for understanding variation in activity space (both perceived and actual)?

-   Are there associations between particular built environment features and health outcomes in real time?

-   What can we learn about the relationship between the built environment, activity space, and the social origins of health outcomes?

**Long-term deliverable**

-   Aim for ASA submission in April, 2024

**Workflow**

-   Álvaro and Thelonious: Begin looking for any data on Cook County between 2016-2020

    -   Log data in source list to prevent overlap

    -   Create relevant merges and documentation notes as necessary
