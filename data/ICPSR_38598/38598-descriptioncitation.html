		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This collection contains measures of land cover (e.g., low-, medium-, or high-density development, forest, wetland, open water) derived from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and aggregated by United States census tract and ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA). For each land type, land cover is measured both in total square meters and as a proportion of all land of that type within the tract or the ZCTA.</span></p>

Such a crosswalk is available on the UDS Mapper website at <a href="https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk"> https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk</a>.

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The purpose of these data are to measure land cover based on National Land Cover Database specifications in the continental United States.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> The research team used measures derived from the 2016 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) spatial data released by the U.S. Geological Survey. The team then aggregated the data into annual measures by census tract and ZIP code tabulation area. The data are based on the NLCD data releases (2001, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016) and have been interpolated between adjacent years. The variable <strong>INTP_FLAG</strong> in both datasets indicates whether values have been interpolated.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> All census tracts and ZIP code tabulation areas in the continental United States. No data is available for Alaska, Hawaii, or the United States territories.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> ZIP code tabulation area, Census tract</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Source:</strong> Data and documentation for the ZCTA-level data were originally deposited in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E128862">openICPSR project 128862</a>., Data and documentation for the census tract-level data were originally deposited in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E110663">openICPSR project 110663</a>., Census tract boundaries were obtained from the 2010 TIGER/Line shapefiles., Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium.

								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> aggregate data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Description of Variables:</strong> Variables include measures of green space and blue space (e.g. open water, deciduous forest, evergreen forest) and categories of developed space (e.g. low intensity, medium intensity, high intensity development). For each category of land cover, measures include both the total land cover in each census tract/ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) in square meters and the proportion of land coverage of that type in each tract/ZCTA.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> <p>2022-12-07 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
