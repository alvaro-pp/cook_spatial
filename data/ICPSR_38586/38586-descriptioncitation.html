		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> Prior research has demonstrated that access to parks and greenspace can have a positive impact on many aspects of and contributors to health, including physical activity levels (Kaczynski et al., 2007), healthy aging (Finlay, 2015), and sense of well-being (Larson et al., 2016). Neighborhood parks can also contribute to sense of community (GÃ³mez, 2015). This dataset describes the number and area of parks in each census tract or each ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) in the United States. Measures include the total number of parks, park area, and proportion of park area within each census tract or ZCTA.</span></p>

Such a crosswalk is available on the UDS Mapper website at <a href="https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk">https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk</a>. Sample code for merging the UDS Mapper crosswalk with NaNDA datasets is available at <a href="http://doi.org/10.3886/E124461">http://doi.org/10.3886/E124461</a>., For additional information see the <a href="https://nanda.isr.umich.edu">National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA)</a>.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this study is to examine the number and density of publicly accessible parks within census tracts and ZIP code tabulation areas within the United States.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>The research team projected the TIGER/Line shapefiles for census tracts/ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA) to the North American Albers equal-area conic projection in ArgGIS Pro, then performed a pairwise intersect between the ParkServe and TIGER/Line shapefiles.</p>
<p>To obtain the total number of parks in each tract/ZCTA, the team counted the number of unique ParkIDs of open parks fully or partially overlapping the tract. Parks were defined as open if they had both open status and access (ParkStatus = Open; ParkAccess = Open). Additional parks for which park status was open but access was unknown were treated as open. Some areas had a very high number of parks, so count variables were top-coded at three, five, and ten parks to control for this (<strong>COUNT_OPEN_PARKS_TC3, COUNT_OPEN_PARKS_TC5, COUNT_OPEN_PARKS_TC10</strong>).</p> <p>Finally, the team calculated the total area of each tract/ZCTA in square meters and square miles, the total park area within each tract/ZCTA in square meters and square miles, and the proportion of park area to tract/ZCTA area.</p></span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
