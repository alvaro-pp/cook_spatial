		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This dataset contains yearly counts from 2000 to 2018 of polluting sites in each United States census tract and within a 0.5-mile buffer to capture spillover effects and in each United States ZIP code tabulation area. Polluting sites are taken from the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory. These facilities are typically larger and involved in manufacturing, metal mining, electric power generation, chemical manufacturing, and hazardous waste treatment.</span></p>

<p>Data and documentation for the ZCTA-level data were originally deposited in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E159981V1">openICPSR project 159981</a>.</p>, A ZIP code to ZCTA crosswalk must be used to combine this dataset with ZIP code geocoded data. Such a crosswalk is available on the UDS Mapper website at <a href="https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk">https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk/</a>. Sample code for merging the UDS Mapper crosswalk with NaNDA datasets is available at <a href="http://doi.org/10.3886/E124461">http://doi.org/10.3886/E124461</a>., For additional information please see the <a href="https://nanda.isr.umich.edu">National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA)</a>.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of disamenities, in this case polluting sites, on neighborhood walkability.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>The Principal Investigators obtained the latitudes and longitudes of all polluting sites appearing in file type 1A (Facility, Chemical, Releases, and Other Waste Management Summary Information) of the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) in reporting years 2000 through 2018. Agencies with ten or more employees that manufacture, process, or use chemicals from a list maintained by the EPA are required to self-report data for the TRI annually (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021).</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro was used to create 0.5-mile buffers around all U.S. census tracts. The Principal Investigators then
performed a spatial join to assign each polluting site's latitude and longitude to the census tracts (plus buffers) within which it falls. (Polluting locations for which census tracts could not be determined are excluded from this dataset.) A 0.5-mile buffer was used to approximate the effect of sites not only within a neighborhood itself, but in nearby or adjoining neighborhoods. The last step was then to count the total number of polluting sites within each census tract plus buffer in each year.</p></span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
